        The marine life on mother earth is dying at an increasing rate, 
        because of plastic pollution. Large rivers around the world contribute to 90% of the 
        plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans. At the current rate there will be more 
        plastic than fish in our oceans by 2050. According to
        <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/alex-gray" target="_blank">Alex Gray</a> in 
        World Economic Forum<br><br><br><br>
        Information gathered from:

<h2 id="Solution" class="flex-container">Solving the problem</h2>
    <p class="flex-middle">Our solution is based around modifying bacteria, so that they connect different 
        types of plastic molecules to each other. This makes the vast amounts of plastic much easier to spot
    and fetch out of the rivers, before it reaches an ocean. So it can be disposed of in a more 
    environmentally friendly way...<br> DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE
