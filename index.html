<h1>Solution name</h1>


<div class="flex-container">
    <p class="flex-left">The marine life on mother earth is dying at an increasing rate, 
        because of plastic pollution. Large rivers around the world contribute to 90% of the 
        plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans. At the current rate there will be more 
        plastic than fish in our oceans by 2050.
    </p>

    <p id="UN" class="flex-right">The <acronym title="United Nations">UN</acronym> has several goals 
        aimed at making earth a better place to inhabit for everyone. Their 14<sup>th</sup>
        <acronym title="Sustainable Development Goal">SDG</acronym> is to <q cite ="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">conserve and 
        sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources.</q> We want to help them reach their 1st target.
        Which is:<br>
        <q cite="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">By 2025, prevent and significantly 
            reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, 
            including marine debris and nutrient pollution.</q><br><br>
            Which you can read more about here:

<h2 id="Solution" class="flex-container">Solving the problem</h2>
    <p class="flex-middle">Our solution is based around modifying bacteria, so that they connect different 
        types of plastic molecules to each other. This makes the vast amounts of plastic much easier to spot
    and fetch out of the rivers, before it reaches an ocean. So it can be disposed of in a more 
    environmentally friendly way.</p>
