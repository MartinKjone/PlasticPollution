    <p class="flex-middle">!TEMPORARY!Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles 
        (e.g. plastic bottles, bags and microbeads) in the Earth's environment 
        that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans. 
        Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, 
        based on size. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, 
        and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. However, 
        the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural 
        processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, 
        these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment.
        Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. It is estimated that 1.1 to 
        8.8 million tonnes of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year.
